## DESCRIPTION :

Cricket Match Winner Prediction
This Python project demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a Machine Learning model that predicts the winner of a cricket match based on match details like teams, location, toss result, and decision.

🏏 Features:
📊 Input Dataset: Match records including team names, location, toss winner, decision, and final winner

🔁 Categorical Encoding: Converts text-based data to numerical format

📉 Visualization: Bar chart showing match wins per team

🧠 Model Training: Logistic Regression using Scikit-learn

📈 Evaluation: Accuracy score and classification report

🎯 Prediction: Predicts the winner of a sample future match

🔧 Technologies Used:
Pandas – For data handling

Matplotlib – For graphing team win counts

Scikit-learn – For model training, evaluation, and prediction

🛠️ Workflow:
Data Preparation

Created a sample dataset with match details

Encoded categorical features for ML use

Visualization

Plotted number of wins per team using a bar chart

Modeling

Trained a Logistic Regression model

Evaluated using test data

Prediction

Simulated a new match scenario and predicted the winner
